# SET game

This project is a desktop application that recreates the popular card game SET. SET is a game that is based on mathematical principles and is one of my favorite games to play.

## Features
- The main screen of the app is a "Hello" screen that displays a brief overview of the rules of the game.
- At the bottom of the screen, there are three buttons: Start Game, Help, and More Cards, and a Score field.
- Start Game button displays the first 12 cards of the game on the screen.
- Help button highlights one card from an existing SET on the screen with a green color. If there is no SET on the screen, the Help button will add 3 more cards.
- More Cards button adds 3 more cards to the screen, but if there is a SET on the screen, it will work like the Help button and highlights one card from an existing SET on the screen with a green color.
- Users can select cards on the screen by clicking on them. The selected cards will be highlighted with a black color. To deselect a card, the user can simply click on it again.
- If the cards in the deck run out, the user can still find another SET.
- At the end of the game, the user will see their final score and the time taken to finish the game.
